# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the web page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install/yarn install`

Install all the dependencies for the development.

### `npm run dev/yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in real time within your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The bundle tool is powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

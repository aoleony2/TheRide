###  **The Ride** - a safe, decentralized, and transparent tutoring platform

**Objestive** To create a platform aim to connect students and provide immediate tutoring help.

A **student** in the University can become a tutor to help other students based on their experience while earning income. 

A **student** can ask about anything related to their academic/career and will receive instant, relevant, and helpful feedback.

##### The Ride is the platform that connects and protects them. A student can sign up as Tutor and offer their service for a fee. A student can post what they need help for and assign a bounty. 

**We ensure transparency and protection for both the Tutor and the Student:** 

- No Academic Offences to worry about
  - Every user must be currently enrolled in the University.
  - We will provide the database to the University if they see potential academic misbehaviour for a Student Tutor pair.
  - This will ensure that No Tutor or Student will have the courage to conduct Academic Offences.

- No worries about not paying or paying less or paying more
  - We will keep the fee during the tutoring session until it's over.
  - We will ensure Tutor gets their required payment when a session is over.
  - We would return the payment if a Tutor did not show up for that session.

- Minimum negative experience while teaching/learning
  - Rating and Panrizing system to ensure quality of Tutors and Students where Tutor and Student will need to rate each other after each session



##### Potential Criticisim (From Teaching Assistant) and our Responses:

- **Q:** Why invest in tutoring when certain courses hold FSGs, and when there maybe multiple office hours and tutorials? / Student clubs already offer career advice and it is free. ie CSSC is a department run club where students can ask other students career based questions. Students can also direct such questions to their profs that may be more knowledgeable about such matters.

- - **A:** As third-year Computer Science students, we understand these services exist and could be helpful for students if they have a well-sorted plan or have good use of resources on campus. But the reality is, most students don't have this advantage: They ask for help only when they encounter a problem, and once they see there is no fitted office hour or the response they got from the piazza/TA/Prof is not much help, they either stop asking and go with it or get very frustrated and stuck on for a while. We encourage students to ask whenever they have a question, small or big. We want them to get immediate and relevant help, though different from what they might acquire directly from actual TA and Prof, they can get the help they need.

- **Q:** What if the tutor goes above and beyond their work, and creates unique solutions to problems for the student? No plagiarism detector will be able to catch that. / Sometimes same assignments and midterms from previous offerings are administered in newer terms. How can we ensure that the tutor did not provide midterm or assignment solutions to the student from a previous offering?

- - **A:** We are not here to eliminate Academic Offences; we wish we could stop them, but we know we can't. We do our best to punish such behaviours by giving the University complete access to our databases. However, we understand that academic dishonesty behaviour can happen anywhere, on any platform. For example, students can form groups on social media apps such as Facebook and share their answers or the previous year's solution. Facebook did not promote this behaviour and had no way of punishing it. At least we are better in the way that we have a way of helping the University detect and punish such behaviours. The only thing we can promise is that Academic Offese will never happen on our site.

- **Academic dishonesty can occur on any platform, and it is impossible to eliminate it. The best approach is to have measures to detect and punish such behaviours, such as giving the University access to tutoring databases. In summary, our project is beneficial for students as it allows them to ask for help whenever needed, regardless of whether a scheduled office hour or tutorial is available.**




**Example Usage Scenarios:**

- Can't attend OH or late piazza replies/don't find the responses helpful
- Needs extra help but usually feels too shy to ask
- Needs some relevant mentor who is maybe only a year older than you that is doing what you want to do / more relevant
- Ask for the understanding of a concept learnt in class or guides on how to study/review a course
- Career role advises how to become a TA, RA, or Software Engineer
- Help design a study plan for a specific class or a semester / help answer questions they have encountered.
- Help express their experience of their academic path or career path



**Future Marketing Plan:**

- Who are our target audiences
  - Students who seek instant, relevant and helpful feedback on their academic/career life
  - Students who have relatively more experience and are willing to be a tutor that gains income while helping other students

- Marketing Research
  - OHs are not flexible. They may conflict with Student's schedule.
  - Piazza may not be responded to in time and might not be helpful.
  - Career centers or Academic advisement centers are fully booked.
  - Other tutoring services are centralized and taught by people who are not even related to the University. Therefore results in a high probability of unrelated materials and plagiarism while charging high fees.

- How do we make money?
  - We charge a percentage of the fees between each transaction
  - We do advertising partnerships

- How do we get new customers?
  - We send out 30$ coupons to users that can be used for paying fees.

- How do we plan to expand?
  - Our first release will target students of UTM.
    - Since there are 15200 students currently enrolled in UTM, the first stage of success would be having 1/10 of the students use The Ride (1520).

  - After that success, we will push and test our app in UTSG and UTSC.

  - We will then expand to all Universities in Ontario and later to Canada.

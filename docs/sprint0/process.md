**Decision Making**
  Decisions about the features of our website, both the design of frontend interface and backend apis, 
  are discussed during the group meeting, and after voting on different ideas, a decision is made. 
  For example, when deciding the project ideas and everyone has presented their ideas, 
  we start a vote to decide eventually we are going to design a tutoring platform.
  
**Prioirtizing User Stories**
  The User stories will be prioritized based on
    - How common this scenario would happen
    - How essential this function is to our project
    - The simplicity it would take to create the backend

**Meetings**
  For the standup meeting, we will join the official CSC301 discord server, where TAs can provide us with more help on our project. For our own small     meetings, we all agree that we will have an in-person meeting every Wednesday from 11:00 am to 12:00 am on campus.
  
**Next Phase**
  In our next phase, we will start to work on our user registration and question entity. Our goal is to create a simple functioning code. In addition we want to maybe start having a note taker to help us better communicate with each other. We also want every group member to learn how to use docker since each group member may have a different OS .

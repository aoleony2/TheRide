The intent of this idea is good, but it seems that there could potentially be a lot of issues with academic dishonesty and there may also be a lot of
additional resources for students to refer to already:
-	Why invest in tutoring when certain courses hold FSGs, and when there maybe multiple office hours and tutorials? And also I 
  think this is something that UTM already does. Iâ€™ve seen emails where they ask if students are interested in private tutoring
  other students that they are not TAing. 
- Student clubs already offer career advice and it is free. ie CSSC is a department run club where students can ask other students career based questions.
  Students can also direct such questions to their profs that may be more knowledgeable about such matters. 
-	What if the tutor goes above and beyond their work, and creates unique solutions to problems for the student? No plagiarism 
  detector will be able to catch that.
-	Sometimes same assignments and midterms from previous offerings are administered in newer terms. How can we ensure that the
  tutor did not provide midterm or assignment solutions to the student from a previous offering?

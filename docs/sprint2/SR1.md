Participants: Haike Yu, Suqing Liu, Pengcheng Wang, Vicky Chen, Liang Yao, Jack Yang

Some unfinished tasks include:

Linking profile and question apis with front end
Correcting documentations to the right format

##Good practices that we should continue for the next sprint:##

Being in person and doign code together
We maintained good communications throughout sprint 2
We distributed our tasks equally among the group

##Harmful practices that we should stop doing:##

We had a bit more stress on our front end as everyone had to merge with one person and he had more work load


New practices that we would like to try for the next sprint:

Incorporate both front and back end in our user stories
write documentation earlier

Best/worst experiences:

We were all able to learn something new about software development
Enhanced our skills of cooperation
Heavy documentation and sometimes unclear instructions given in the handout
